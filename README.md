# Alzheimer-Disease
## Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative
disease. This disease occurs when the neurons in the brain starts degenerating and it
generally affects the elderly people. It has no cure if the patient is in the last stage, so the
classification of the disease at an early stage is very important for the treatment.
Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases of dementia. In early stages of
disease, also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), memory loss is mild, but with
late-stage Alzheimer’s, the patient loses the ability to even carry on a conversation.
Nowadays doctors widely use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose various
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, but this method is prone to human error.
Thus, Deep learning plays a vital role in the classification, detection and segmentation of
data.
